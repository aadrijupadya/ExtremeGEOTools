## **Key Concepts to Focus On:**

### 1. **Data Flow Architecture**
```
User Query â†’ Frontend Form â†’ Backend API â†’ AI Engine â†’ 
Response Processing â†’ Entity Extraction â†’ Database Storage â†’ 
Metrics Aggregation â†’ Dashboard Display
```

### 2. **Database Schema Understanding**
- **Runs Table**: Stores individual query executions with full metadata
- **Daily Metrics Table**: Aggregated daily statistics for analysis
- **JSONB Fields**: Flexible storage for entities, citations, and enriched data

### 3. **API Structure**
- RESTful endpoints with consistent response formats
- Query parameters for filtering and pagination
- Error handling and status codes
- Data transformation between database and API responses

### 4. **Frontend State Management**
- React hooks for local state
- API service layer for backend communication
- Component props and data flow
- User interaction and form handling

## **Quick Wins (1 hour total):**

- **Start with `backend/main.py`** - this gives you the big picture
- **Look at `backend/app/models/run.py`** - this shows you what data looks like
- **Check `frontend/src/App.js`** - this shows you the user flow

## **What to Skip Initially:**

- CSS/styling details
- Complex business logic in metrics calculations
- Docker/deployment configuration
- Alembic migration details
- Advanced error handling edge cases

## **Pro Tips for Understanding:**

### 1. **Use the Browser Dev Tools**
- Open Network tab to see what API calls the frontend is making
- Check Console for any error messages or debugging output
- Use React DevTools to inspect component state

### 2. **Check the Database Directly**
- Connect to PostgreSQL to see what data actually exists
- Run simple queries to understand the data structure
- Check if the data matches what you expect

### 3. **Follow One Query Through the System**
- Submit a test query from the frontend
- Watch the backend logs to see the processing
- Check the database to see what was stored
- Verify the frontend displays the results correctly

### 4. **Look at Console Logs**
- The frontend has debugging output for API calls
- Backend has logging for request processing
- Check for any error messages or warnings

## **Common Gotchas to Watch For:**

1. **Import Paths**: The backend expects to be run from the root directory
2. **Database Connections**: Check if PostgreSQL is running and accessible
3. **API Endpoints**: Verify the frontend is calling the correct backend URLs
4. **Data Format**: JSONB fields can have different structures
5. **Async Operations**: Many operations are asynchronous, check for proper await usage

## **When You're Ready to Dive Deeper:**

- **Performance Optimization**: Database query optimization, caching strategies
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing
- **Deployment**: Docker configuration, environment variables, production setup
- **Monitoring**: Logging, metrics collection, and alerting

## **Questions to Ask Yourself While Reading:**

1. **What happens when a user submits a query?**
2. **How is the response processed and stored?**
3. **What data is aggregated for the dashboard?**
4. **How does the frontend get and display the data?**
5. **What happens when something goes wrong?**

## **Resources for Further Learning:**

- **FastAPI Documentation**: For understanding the backend framework
- **React Documentation**: For frontend component patterns
- **SQLAlchemy Documentation**: For database ORM understanding
- **PostgreSQL JSONB**: For understanding the flexible data storage

**Remember**: Start with the high-level flow, then dive into specific components. Don't try to understand everything at once - focus on one piece at a time and build your mental model gradually.

Good luck with the deep dive! ðŸš€
